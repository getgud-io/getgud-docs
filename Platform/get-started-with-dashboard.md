- Attach the first guard law to your title
- Understand and set up your first filter
- Understand and set up your first query
- Understand and set up your first rule

Those 4 steps cover the most basic cycle so that Getgud can start processing your data, generating insights and sending those to you.

Before you continue with this tutorial we recommend reading [Get started](https://github.com/getgud-io/getgud-docs/blob/main/get-started.md) tutorial to understand Getgud.io platform better.

## Attach a guard law

Guard laws are a crucial component of the Getgud platform, designed to monitor and analyze your game's streamed matches for specific toxic behaviors. A Guard law is essentially a piece of code that scans the data from your matches, detecting unwanted or harmful activities performed by players. 

We are constantly working on our Guard Laws and improving their accuracy, currently we support the following laws on our platform:
- Basic Aimbot Protection
- Rapid Fire Protection
- AFK Protection
- Friendly Fire Protection

To register a guard law follow the steps described in [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/4a7rFfUTUrI?list=PLMIGIFMfKUAv4AQHvnv4PzSvmd9dsYk0p&t=88)


## Understand and set up your first filter

Filters in the Getgud platform are essential to manage and control the flow of data from your title to the Getgud platform. They serve several critical functions, each tailored to specific needs and use cases. 

Getgud supports 3 types of filters:
- Stream Filters: Control which matches are streamed from your game server to the Getgud platform. You might use stream filters to limit the amount of data being sent, ensuring only a representative sample of matches is streamed. This helps in managing bandwidth.
- Store Filters: Decide which matches will be stored on the platform for replay and future analysis.
- Analyze Filters: Determine which matches will be analyzed by specific Guard laws.

Note: Only streamed matches can be analyzed and stored and only stored matches can be analyzed!

To set up the filter follow the steps described in [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/4a7rFfUTUrI?list=PLMIGIFMfKUAv4AQHvnv4PzSvmd9dsYk0p&t=122).

## Understand and set up your first query

## Understand and set up your first rule

Rules in the Getgud platform allow you to take specific actions based on the behaviors and conditions identified by your Guard Laws and filters. By defining rules, you can proactively manage player behavior, enforce game policies, and maintain a healthy gaming environment.

Rules allow you to transmit insights generated by Getgud to external systems like databases and CRMs via webhooks. 

A few examples of rules include:
- Ban all toxic players in your system
- Notify all AFK players via email
- Promote all players who played more than 100 hours

To set up your first rule follow the steps described in [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/4a7rFfUTUrI?list=PLMIGIFMfKUAv4AQHvnv4PzSvmd9dsYk0p&t=194)
