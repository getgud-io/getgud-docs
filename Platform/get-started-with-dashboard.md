## Understanding and setting up filters

Filters in the Getgud platform are essential to manage and control the flow of data from your title to the Getgud platform. They serve several critical functions, each tailored to specific needs and use cases. 

We support 3 types of filters:
- Stream Filters: Control which matches are streamed from your game server to the Getgud platform. You might use stream filters to limit the amount of data being sent, ensuring only a representative sample of matches is streamed. This helps in managing bandwidth.
- Store Filters: Decide which matches will be stored on the platform for replay and future analysis.
- Analyze Filters: Determine which matches will be analyzed by specific Guard laws.

Note: Only streamed matches can be analyzed and stored and only stored matches can be analyzed!

To set up the filter follow steps described in [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/4a7rFfUTUrI?list=PLMIGIFMfKUAv4AQHvnv4PzSvmd9dsYk0p&t=122).
