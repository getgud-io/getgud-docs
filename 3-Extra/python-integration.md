# Getgud.io Python SDK

## What Can You Do With Getgud's SDK:

Getgud's Python SDK allows you to integrate your game with the Getgud platform. Once integrated, you will be able to:

- Stream live game data to Getgud's cloud, including in-match actions, in-match reports, and in-match chat messages.
- Send Reports about historical matches to Getgud.
- Send (and update) player information to Getgud.

## Getting Started

Set the environment variables `GETGUD_TITLE_ID` and `GETGUD_PRIVATE_KEY` with the Title Id and Private Key you received from Getgud.io, or use them as arguments for StartGame. 

First, import the SDK:

```python
from getgudsdk_wrapper import GetgudSDK
import time
```

Initialize the SDK:

```python
sdk = GetgudSDK()
```

Start a Game:

```python
game_guid = sdk.start_game(
    title_id=28,
    private_key="your_private_key",
    server_guid="cs2-server-1",  # max 36 chars
    game_mode="deathmatch",  # max 36 chars
    server_location="203.0.113.42"  # max 36 chars
)
```

Once the Game starts, you'll receive the Game's guid, now you can start a Match:

```python
match_guid = sdk.start_match(
    game_guid=game_guid, 
    match_mode="Knives-only",  # max 36 chars
    map_name="de-dust"  # max 36 chars
)
```

Once you create a match, you can send Actions to it.
Let's create a spawn action and send it to the match:

```python
action_time_epoch = int(time.time() * 1000)
sdk.send_spawn_action(
    match_guid=match_guid,
    action_time_epoch=action_time_epoch,
    player_guid="player-10",
    character_guid="character-1",
    team_guid="team-1",
    initial_health=100.0,
    position=(1.0, 2.0, 3.0),
    rotation=(10.0, 20.0, 0.0)
)
```

End a game (All Game's Matches will close as well):

```python
result = sdk.mark_end_game(game_guid)
```

Close and Dispose of the SDK:

```python
sdk.dispose()
```

## SDK Methods

### __init__()

Initializes the SDK. You can call this method in three ways:

```python
sdk = GetgudSDK()
sdk.__init_conf_path__(config_file_path)
sdk.__init_conf__(config_file, passAsContent)
```

- The first version uses default configuration.
- The second version allows you to specify a path to a configuration file.
- The third version allows you to pass the configuration content directly (if `passAsContent` is True) or as a file path (if `passAsContent` is False).

### dispose()

## Configuration and Logging

The default Config file is loaded during initialization. You can specify a custom configuration file path or pass the configuration content directly using the `__init_conf_path__` or `__init_conf__` methods.

Example of configuration file `config.json`:

```json
{
  "streamGameURL": "https://api.staging.getgud.io/api/game_stream/send_game_packet",
  "updatePlayersURL": "https://api.staging.getgud.io/api/player_data/update_players_via_sdk",
  "sendReportsURL": "https://api.staging.getgud.io/api/report_data/send_reports",
  "throttleCheckUrl": "https://api.staging.getgud.io/api/game_stream/throttle_match_check",
  "logToFile": true,
  "logFileSizeInBytes": 10000000,
  "circularLogFile": true,
  "reportsMaxBufferSizeInBytes": 100000,
  "maxReportsToSendAtOnce": 100,
  "playersMaxBufferSizeInBytes": 100000,
  "maxPlayerUpdatesToSendAtOnce": 100,
  "maxChatMessagesToSendAtOnce": 100,
  "gameSenderSleepIntervalMilliseconds": 100,
  "apiTimeoutMilliseconds": 5000,
  "apiWaitTimeMilliseconds": 5000,
  "packetMaxSizeInBytes": 2000000,
  "actionsBufferMaxSizeInBytes": 50000000,
  "gameContainerMaxSizeInBytes": 100000000,
  "maxGames": 25,
  "maxMatchesPerGame": 50,
  "minPacketSizeForSendingInBytes": 1000000,
  "packetTimeoutInMilliseconds": 10000,
  "gameCloseGraceAfterMarkEndInMilliseconds": 20000,
  "liveGameTimeoutInMilliseconds": 60000,
  "hyperModeFeatureEnabled": false,
  "hyperModeMaxThreads": 10,
  "hyperModeAtBufferPercentage": 10,
  "hyperModeUpperPercentageBound": 90,
  "hyperModeThreadCreationStaggerMilliseconds": 100,
  "logLevel": "FULL"
}
```

### Logging

The SDK logs its operations based on the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file. To control logging, use the following configuration parameters:

- `logToFile`: Set to `true` to enable logging to file, `false` to disable.
- `logFileSizeInBytes`: Maximum size of the log file before it's rotated (default: 10 MB).
- `circularLogFile`: If `true`, the log file will be overwritten from the beginning when it reaches the maximum size. If `false`, a new log file will be created.
- `logLevel`: Controls the verbosity of logging. Options are "FULL", "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", and "FATAL".

To change the location of the log file, you can set the `GETGUD_LOG_FILE_PATH` environment variable to the desired file path.

## Examples

Here's a more comprehensive example of using the Getgud Python SDK:

```python
from getgudsdk_wrapper import GetgudSDK
import time

# Initialize the SDK
sdk = GetgudSDK()

# Start a game
game_guid = sdk.start_game(
    title_id=28,
    private_key="your_private_key",
    server_guid="cs2-server-1",
    game_mode="deathmatch",
    server_location="203.0.113.42"
)

# Start a match
match_guid = sdk.start_match(
    game_guid=game_guid,
    match_mode="Knives-only",
    map_name="de-dust"
)

# Send a spawn action
action_time_epoch = int(time.time() * 1000)

    tb_time_epoch=int(time.time() * 1000),
    suggested_toxicity_score=75,
    reported_time_epoch=int(time.time() * 1000)
)

# Update player information

    title_id=28,
    private_key="your_private_key",
    player_guid="player-10",
    player_nickname="John Doe",
    player_email="john@example.com",

            "TransactionName": "In-Game Purchase",
            "TransactionDateEpoch": int(time.time() * 1000),
            "TransactionValueUSD": 9.99
        }
    ]
)

# End the game

# Dispose of the SDK
sdk.dispose()
```

This example demonstrates how to use various methods of the Getgud Python SDK, including starting a game and match, sending different types of actions, sending chat messages and reports, updating player information, and ending the game.

Remember to replace "your_private_key" with your actual private key provided by Getgud.io, and adjust other parameters as needed for your specific game implementation.

For more detailed examples and use cases, refer to the [examples](https://github.com/getgud-io/cpp-getgud-sdk-dev/tree/main/examples) directory in the Getgud SDK repository.
